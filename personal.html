				Hi! My name is Kazuya Erdos, though I go by Kaz. I was born in Newton, MA and have lived in the small town of Maynard since then.
				
			<br><br>
				I have an older brother who currently attends <a href= "https://www.webb.edu/" class = "link">Webb Institute of Nautical Engineering. &nbsp;</a>It is a small school of about 100 students located in Glen Cove, Long
				Island. Interestingly, they used the campus in the filming of some of the Batman movies!
			<br><br>
				I would describe myself as an energetic, light-hearted person who loves to embarrass themselves at any given opportunity. I am never afraid to 
				volunteer myself in front of a class or a group of people!
			<br><br>
				I came to MAMS to challenge myself and work with some of the most brilliant young minds I have ever seen. It blows my mind how amazing our student body 
				and faculty is, and it is such a privilege and joy to work with them.

				I attended all of Pre-K and Elementary school at the Maynard Public Schools System.
				<br><br>
				In sixth grade, I transferred to the Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School <a href = "https://www.amsacs.org/" class = "link">(AMSACS)&nbsp;</a>
				in Marlborough, MA. I stayed there through Tenth Grade.
				<br><br>
				Then I applied to the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science (MAMS) and got in! I am currently attending as a Junior.

				<Strong>What built me up.</Strong>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				In sixth grade, AMSA had its annual Pi-Day Competition on 3/14. I didn't think much of it, but after all of the individual rounds I found 
				myself in first place for Sixth grade! That allowed me to compete in the team round with students from 6th-8th grade. My team, which funnily enough 
				had another future MAMS student in it, ended up taking first place.
				
				<br><br>
				
				That first exposure to Mathematics as a competition inspired me to join the AMSA Middle School Math Team in seventh grade. I had a blast my first year 
				competing in the IMLEM League, and our school did very well.
				
				<br><br>
				
				I stuck with the AMSA Math Team through Tenth Grade, becoming Co-Captain of the Middle School and Freshman Teams in 8th and 9th grade.
				Our school competed in the Worcester County Math League <a href = "https://www.wocomal.org/" class = "link">(WOCOMAL)&nbsp;</a>, and I was able to compete on the Varsity Team!
				
				<br><br>
				
				Moving forward, I will be competing with the MAMS Math Team this coming season, and I am very excited to see what the future holds 
				for me in Competitive Mathematics. 
				
				<br><br>
				
				Math team has taught me how to think outside the box, since most to all of the solutions to the problems require thinking
				in a new and unique way, and often new solution strategies must be invented.

				Sports:
			</div>
			<p class = hidden>
				<Strong>What got me moving.</Strong>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				My first sport from a young age was baseball. I had a blast playing the majority of my years in little league under my father as a coach. 
				I played all the way up until tenth grade, when my passion for the sport eventually dropped off.
				<br><br>
				The sport that took me by storm at that point was track and field. I started the sport in seventh grade and quickly grew to love it. 
				I made it to the Massachusetts States meet in eighth grade and ended up finished sixth place in the 400m dash, and our school's 4x100m 
				relay team finished third! My standout year, however, was ninth grade. I specialized in the 400m dash, running the individual event as well
				as the 4x400m relay, with the occasional 4x100 relay. My best time for the 400m was 57.72 seconds. At the Colonial Athletic League finals, our 
				4x400 relay team won gold!
				<br><br>
				During the winter before tenth grade, some of my friends urged me to start playing soccer. I had never played the sport before, save one year
				of Recreational Town Soccer when I was in elementary school. Being a beginner, I struggled to keep up with their foot skills and shooting, so I 
				decided that I would try to be a goal keeper. Immediately I knew that I was made for that position, and I played for the AMSA soccer team 
				my sophomore year of high school. It was such a blast, and I learned so much along the way. Though I am currently not able to play soccer for 
				a school, I continue to have fun with the sport on my own time and with my friends!

				Piano:
			</div>
			<p class = hidden>
				<Strong>My emotional outlet.</Strong>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I began playing the piano when I was five years old. We had an old piano from my grandmother in our house, and I used to love just hitting the 
				keys and seeing what sound would come out. I have stuck with it for 12 years now, and my love for the instrument is only growing. 
				<br><br>
				
				Over time, I began to develop interests in different categories of piano music. My first love was Rag Time, which is a jazz-like genre
				of piano that relies on a syncopated, light-hearted rhythm. The undisputed King of Rag Time is Scott Joplin. I have bounced around
				the Impressionist, Classical, and Baroque movements, playing the likes of Debussey, Bach, and Schumann.
				
				<br><br>
				By far, my favorite composer of all time has to be Frederik Chopin. His music utilizes a powerful technique known as tempo rubato, 
				where the tempo can be stretched and bent to create an emotional, heart-felt effect. I am currently working on playing the first piece
				from his collection of Ballades.
				
				<br><br>
				
				Recently, I was invited to perform in the <a href = "https://nepta.com" class = "link">New England Piano Teaacher's Association (NEPTA) Recital&nbsp;</a> 
				in the intermediate age group. It was definitely a humbling experience to see such talented young musicians, and I look forward to going
				back again.
				<br><br>
